    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French toast is the best breakfast out there. It’s the sweetest, fluffiest way to start the day. It aslo happens to be one of the easiest to make breakfasts that looks the most impressive. A giant platter of brioche French toast topped with fruit and syrup is a glorious thing!</p>
    <p>If you’ve never had brioche French toast before promise me you’re going to do it. It’s perfect in the summer with summer sweet peaches or in the fall with toasted caramelized nuts. It goes perfectly with golden brown breakfast sausages and crispy bacon. I could eat brioche French toast every day of the year and never be tired of it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Cream and milk</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul> 
    <h2>Steps</h2>     
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow bowl (that will fit the brioche flat), whisk together the eggs, cream, milk, and sugar, making sure the eggs are completely incorporated.</li>
        <li>Take a piece of brioche and put it in the custard mixture and let soak, flipping once.</li>
        <li>Heat up a cast iron or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a bit of oil and butter and when the oil and butter are hot, add the custard soaked bread (let the excess drip back into the shallow bowl) and cook until golden and crisp on the bottom side.</li>
        <li>Gently flip and continue to cook until the other side is golden and crisp. Turn the heat up to medium high if needed to brown.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with butter, syrup, fruit, and powdered sugar, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
